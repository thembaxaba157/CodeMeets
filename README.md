### PROJECT DESCRIPTION
> **WeThinkCode_** introduced **Coding Clinics** to help students share challenges they are facing with the coding problems. A student needs to book a specific time slot to attend a *Coding Clinic session*, and typically these sessions are one-on-one sessions with a more experienced person who can advise on the coding problem at hand.
- My team was tasked to create a set of ***command-line tools*** that will automate the booking system. The system must allow students to see where there are available time slots for specific dates and campuses, and allow them to book sessions. To ensure that there are no double bookings, it must synchronise with the Coding Clinicâ€™s Google calendars, as well as the students' own calendars.
